NOTE 1: If you made contest QSOs in the first weekend, not using N1MM+, you can enter those contacts manually into a new N1MM+ contest log before the second weekend (date and time should be corrected manually). This will help to avoid DUPE contacts during the second part of the contest. NOTE 2: N1MM+ is unable to calculate Off Times correctly because N1MM+ determines off times based on QSOs logged and the contest rules require that you take listening times into account. Also the rules specify local time for Start and End of contest which is very unusual.",
